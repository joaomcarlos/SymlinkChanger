# SymlinkChanger
Quickly change Symlinks, ideal to put point different root projects into your MAMP's htdocs directory

# How to use
Open SymlinkChanger.php and edit the $pathToMamp (full path) and the projects you want to use.

You can add as many projects as you want.
Name is just for the graphical interface.
Path is for the projects full path.

After you have changed all the settings to your liking, open up Platypus.app
App Name: SymlinkChanger (or what ever you want really)
Script Type: PHP
Script Path : Press "Select..." and navigate to the SymlinkChanger.php you edited earlier.
Uncheck "Remain running after initial execution", all other checks its ok to leave default.

Press Create.

After that you get a nice application that asks you what to change your symlink to and does it.

Simple and effective.
